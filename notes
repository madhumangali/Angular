Angular :-
-----------
Angular is used for building client-side applications using HTML, CSS and a programming language like JavaScript or TypeScript.
Angular is not a programming language in itself like JavaScript. Instead, it is a framework which uses a programming language like JavaScript/TypeScript.
Angular is a JavaScript Framework which allows us to create Single-page Applications.

Single-page Applications :-
--------------------------
In a single-page application only one html page contains and the content will vary.

advantages :-
-------------
SPA makes a web application faster and gives the user a reactive experience.
Using JavaScript to change the content of the webpage dynamically is much faster than having to reach out to the server for every page change 
and for every new piece of data we want to display.
If we do need some data from the server, we can load it in the background without making the webpage unresponsive.

why use Angular? :-
------------------
We can use JavaScript or jQuery to do the same thing which we can do with Angular. But As the application grows:
Vanilla JavaScript or jQuery code becomes hard to maintain and we will need a way to properly structure our application.
A lot of applications built using vanilla JavaScript/jQuery is hard to test.
Angular gives our application a clean and loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand & maintain.
It brings a lot of utility code which can be re-used in lot of applications. Especially, when dealing with user navigation & browser history.
Applications built with Angular are more testable.

Setup :-
--------
Node Installation.
Angular ClI installation.
To terminate live development server, press - Ctrl + —Å
To restart the development server, run command ng serve.

TypeScript :-
--------------
TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript.
TypeScript has additional features that do not exist in current version of JavaScript supported by most browser.
TypeScript is strongly typed. But JavaScript is dynamically typed.
It has object oriented features which we do not have in JavaScript like interface, access modifiers, fields, properties, generics etc.
With typescript, we can catch errors at compile time.

Component :-
-----------
Component is a TypeScript class decorated with @Component decorator and it contains methods & properties which we can use in HTML.
A class: It contains the code required for the view template. That means, it contains the UI logic.
A View template: It defines the user interface. It contains the HTML, directives & data binding.
A decorator: It adds meta data to the class, making it a component.
